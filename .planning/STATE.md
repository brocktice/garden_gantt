## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 coarse phases per coarse granularity (Foundation → Data → Drag/Tasks → Polish/Ship)
- Architecture: Pure-function `domain/` core; React + Zustand `persist` shell; SVG gantt; FullCalendar for calendar
- Stack: React 19 + Vite 7 + TS 6, SVAR React Gantt 2.6 (Frappe fallback), date-fns v4 + UTC noon discipline (not Temporal)
- Persistence: localStorage via Zustand persist for v1; IndexedDB only if 5MB budget breached
- Permapeople: Enrichment-only, lazy, never blocks engine; CORS verification spiked in Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 spike: Permapeople CORS unverified — affects whether enrichment is direct fetch or needs Worker proxy
- Phase 3 kickoff spike: SVAR constraint hook API vs custom SVG drag — affects Phase 3 implementation strategy
